title: About Me
subtitle: Linguistics PhD Student
---

My name is [Austin Keen](https://www.name-coach.com/austin-d-keen), and I am a PhD student in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.northwestern.edu/index.html) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). My main research interests are syntax, psycholinguistics, and aphasia.

My research explores elements of syntactic structures that are relatively hidden, such as gapping and ellipsis. I use psycholinguistic methods like maze tasks, acceptability judgments, and eyetracking to gain more insight into the structure of language in the mind.

I am affiliated with the Syntax, Semantics, and Sentence Processing Lab at Northwestern.

Outside my research, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and playing volleyball in a local league.
